Description:
The application enables users to enter inputs into a inquirer prompt in order to generate a logo "logo.svg" file which contains the users desired results as an SVG image.




 Challenge:
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs to generates a SVG logo and saves it as "logo.svg" file. In addition, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and the passing of all of the tests.

 User Story
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer


Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
